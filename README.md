# MessagePedia WebRTC + Electron

Modern WebRTC + Electron replacement for MessagePedia P2P messaging system, solving JXTA networking issues with reliable peer-to-peer communication and file distribution.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project replaces the legacy JXTA-based MessagePedia implementation with a modern WebRTC + Electron architecture that eliminates the persistent 15-second connection timeout issues while providing superior P2P file distribution capabilities.

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Frontend**: Electron (Chromium + Node.js)
- **P2P Communication**: WebRTC (messaging + file transfer)  
- **Signaling Server**: Node.js + Socket.io (lightweight)
- **Language**: JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Packaging**: Cross-platform desktop app

## 🚀 Key Features

- ✅ **Eliminates JXTA timeout issues** with reliable WebRTC connections
- ✅ **Superior file distribution** with chunked P2P transfers
- ✅ **Cross-platform native** desktop app experience
- ✅ **Modern, maintainable** technology stack
- ✅ **Automatic NAT traversal** for corporate networks

## 🔧 Development Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/MessagePedia-WebRTC-Electron.git
cd MessagePedia-WebRTC-Electron

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development
npm run dev
```

## 📊 Performance Targets

- **Connection establishment**: <2 seconds (vs. JXTA's 15+ second failures)
- **File transfer speed**: >50MB/s on local network  
- **Memory usage**: <200MB Electron app footprint
- **Cross-platform**: Windows 10+, macOS 10.15+, Ubuntu 20+

## 🛠️ Development Methodology

This project uses the **SPARC methodology** enhanced by AI swarm collaboration:
- **S**pecification: Comprehensive requirements analysis
- **P**seudocode: Algorithm design and data structures
- **A**rchitecture: System design and component interactions
- **R**efinement: Continuous optimization and improvement
- **C**ompletion: Testing, documentation, and deployment
