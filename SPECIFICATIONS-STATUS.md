# MessagePedia WebRTC - Specifications Status

## SPARC Phase: S (Specification) - IN PROGRESS

### Completed Specification Work:
- ✅ **System Assertions Extracted**: Core vision, enterprise deployment, product matrix
- ✅ **BDD Feature Files**: Comprehensive scenarios for collective intelligence app
- ✅ **Multi-tier Architecture**: Personal/Professional/Business/Enterprise tiers defined
- ✅ **Target User Segmentation**: Clear user personas by tier
- ✅ **Technology Stack**: P2P + WebRTC + Electron + AWS services defined

### Remaining S Phase Work:
- ⏳ **Technical Feasibility Validation**: Ensure all assertions are implementable
- ⏳ **Architecture Tension Resolution**: Resolve conflicts between P2P and centralized services
- ⏳ **API Design**: Define interfaces between components
- ⏳ **Data Model Design**: Database schemas for multi-tier architecture

### Key Architectural Tensions to Resolve:
1. **P2P vs. Web/Mobile Access**: How Content Service bridges P2P and web clients
2. **Zero-knowledge vs. AWS Cognito**: Centralized auth vs. privacy claims  
3. **Topic Limits vs. P2P**: Enforcing freemium limits in decentralized system
4. **Self-hosting vs. Managed**: Enterprise control vs. ease of deployment

### Next Steps:
1. Complete technical feasibility analysis
2. Design system architecture that resolves tensions
3. Create detailed component specifications
4. Move to P (Planning) phase once S phase is complete

## Important Notes:
- **No implementation until S phase complete**
- **All existing code cleaned up to prepare for new specifications**
- **Focus on resolving architectural conflicts before proceeding**
