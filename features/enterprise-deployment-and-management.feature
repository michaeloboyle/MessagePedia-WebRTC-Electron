# MessagePedia - The Collective Intelligence App

Feature: Enterprise Deployment and Management

  Scenario: Simple Enterprise Server Deployment
    Given an enterprise wants to deploy MessagePedia for their remote team
    When IT installs MessagePedia on any Mac, Windows, or Linux PC that can be always online
    And they use a company email ID for the server installation
    Then the server should be ready to host corporate Topics
    And IT should be able to create Topics for company-controlled content
    And employees should be able to access Topics using their personal email IDs
    And the deployment should require no special server hardware or complex setup

  Scenario: Corporate Asset Management
    Given a company needs to securely manage sensitive corporate documents
    When they create Topics for "Tax and Financial Records", "Board Matters", "Legal Documents", and "Employment Agreements"
    And they invite only employees who need access to each specific Topic
    Then corporate documents should remain under company control and ownership
    And access should be restricted to authorized personnel only
    And the company should maintain full audit trails for compliance
    And sensitive documents should never be exposed to third-party cloud services

  Scenario: Mixed Internal and External Collaboration
    Given a company wants to collaborate with family, friends, and external colleagues for testing
    When employees create Topics and invite both internal team members and external collaborators
    Then the system should handle mixed internal/external access securely
    And corporate Topics should remain separate from personal collaboration Topics
    And external collaborators should only access Topics they're explicitly invited to
    And the company server should maintain availability for all authorized Topics

  Scenario: Distributed Topic Creation by Employees
    Given employees need flexibility to create their own collaboration Topics
    When an employee creates a new Topic for a specific project or initiative
    And they invite both internal colleagues and external partners as needed
    And they also invite the company server to serve as an "always-online proxy"
    Then the Topic should remain available even when the employee's laptop is offline
    And other Topic members should have continuous access through the server proxy
    And the employee should retain ownership and control of their created Topic
    And the server should synchronize all content when the employee comes back online

  Scenario: Identity Separation for Corporate and Personal Use
    Given employees use MessagePedia for both corporate and personal collaboration
    When they access corporate Topics using their personal email IDs
    And they create personal Topics for non-work collaboration
    Then corporate and personal identities should be properly separated
    And employees should not accidentally share corporate content in personal Topics
    And personal Topics should not appear in corporate server administration
    And access controls should prevent cross-contamination between corporate and personal content

  Scenario: Automatic Software Updates in Enterprise Environment
    Given the company has deployed MessagePedia across multiple employees and servers
    When MessagePedia releases software updates with improvements
    Then employees should be able to "quit and restart the app to get the latest update"
    And updates should maintain compatibility with existing Topics and content
    And the server should continue operating normally during client updates
    And update delivery should not compromise security or require manual IT intervention

  Scenario: Remote Team Collaboration with Always-Online Availability
    Given a company has a fully remote team spread across different time zones
    When team members collaborate on time-sensitive projects using MessagePedia Topics
    And they invite the company server to all critical project Topics
    Then collaboration should continue seamlessly across different working hours
    And team members should be able to access shared content regardless of others' online status
    And the server should maintain Topic consistency and availability 24/7
    And remote work should not create barriers to real-time collaboration needs

  Scenario: Linux Enterprise Server Deployment
    Given an enterprise standardizes on Linux infrastructure
    When IT deploys MessagePedia on Ubuntu, CentOS, or RHEL servers
    Then the application should run natively on all major Linux distributions
    And optional Docker containers should be available for enterprises that prefer containerization
    And systemd integration should enable proper service management
    And Linux security models should be fully leveraged for enterprise deployment
    And package management should support .deb, .rpm, AppImage, and Snap formats
    And performance should be optimized for Linux server environments
