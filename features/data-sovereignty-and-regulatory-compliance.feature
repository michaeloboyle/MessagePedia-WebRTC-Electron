# MessagePedia - The Collective Intelligence App

Feature: Data Sovereignty and Regulatory Compliance

  Scenario: Cross-Border Professional Collaboration with Data Sovereignty
    Given Alice is in the US and Bob is in the EU with GDPR requirements
    When they collaborate on professional matters
    Then data should remain in the appropriate jurisdictions
    And GDPR "right to be forgotten" should be enforceable locally
    And data processing should comply with both US and EU regulations
    And no third-party cloud services should create compliance risks

  Scenario: Industry-Specific Regulatory Compliance
    Given Alice works in a highly regulated industry (finance, healthcare, legal)
    When she collaborates with clients and colleagues using MessagePedia
    Then all industry-specific privacy regulations should be maintained
    And compliance documentation should be automatically generated
    And audit capabilities should meet regulatory examination requirements
    And data retention policies should be enforceable locally

  Scenario: Enterprise Data Governance Integration
    Given an enterprise has strict data governance policies
    When employees use MessagePedia for collaboration
    Then the solution should integrate with existing data governance frameworks
    And content classification and handling should respect enterprise policies
    And data loss prevention (DLP) should be maintained
    And administrative controls should be available for IT governance
