# MessagePedia - The Collective Intelligence App

Feature: Cost-Efficient Alternative to Cloud Solutions

  Scenario: Elimination of Cloud Storage Limitations
    Given traditional cloud solutions have file size and storage limits
    When Alice shares large datasets or documents with Bob
    Then MessagePedia should have no artificial file size limits
    And storage should only be limited by users' own hardware
    And time-based access restrictions should not apply
    And users should avoid recurring cloud storage costs

  Scenario: Reduced Infrastructure Costs for Organizations
    Given organizations typically pay for cloud storage and bandwidth
    When an organization adopts MessagePedia for internal collaboration
    Then they should eliminate cloud storage subscription costs
    And bandwidth costs should be reduced through direct P2P transfer
    And data processing costs should be eliminated (local AI processing)
    And total cost of ownership should be significantly lower
