Feature: AI Integration Without Privacy Compromise

  Scenario: Local AI Content Summarization
    Given Alice has a large document that needs summarization for Bob
    When Alice requests AI-powered document summarization
    Then the AI processing should occur entirely on Alice's local system
    And the original document should never leave Alice's control
    And the AI model should not upload content to external AI services
    And Bob should receive only the summary with full encryption

  Scenario: AI-Enhanced Content Analysis for Professional Insights
    Given Alice needs AI analysis of collaborative content for client insights
    When Alice applies AI analysis to shared documents and communications
    Then all AI processing should maintain the same privacy standards
    And AI insights should be generated without compromising content security
    And results should be shared through the same encrypted P2P channels
    And no AI service providers should gain access to professional content

  Scenario: Intelligent Content Organization and Search
    Given Alice and Bob have extensive collaborative content history
    When they need to find specific information from past collaborations
    Then AI-powered search should work on locally stored content
    And search indexes should be maintained locally without cloud exposure
    And intelligent categorization should respect professional confidentiality
    And content discovery should enhance productivity without sacrificing privacy

  Scenario: AI-Enhanced Topic Management
    Given Alice manages multiple Topics with extensive content
    When Alice uses AI to organize and categorize Topic content
    Then AI should analyze content locally without external transmission
    And intelligent suggestions should help organize files and messages
    And AI should respect role-based access controls within Topics
    And automated categorization should maintain privacy standards
