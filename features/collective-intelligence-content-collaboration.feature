# MessagePedia - The Collective Intelligence App

Feature: Collective Intelligence Content Collaboration
  As a professional service provider (financial advisor, accountant, attorney, consultant)
  I want to securely collaborate on sensitive content with clients and colleagues
  So that I can maintain privacy, control, and compliance with data sovereignty laws

  Background:
    Given MessagePedia is "The Collective Intelligence App"
    And all content remains on users' own laptops and servers (no cloud upload)
    And all communication uses end-to-end encryption
    And the system complies with data privacy and sovereignty laws
    And Topics serve as peer-to-peer workspaces with role-based access control
    And files can be of any size with no artificial limitations
    And enterprise deployment requires only "any Mac, Windows, or Linux PC that can be always online"
    And corporate vs. personal identity separation is maintained through email-based access

  Scenario: Professional Service Provider Content Collaboration
    Given Alice is a financial advisor working with sensitive client data
    And Bob is her client with confidential financial documents
    When Alice and Bob establish a secure P2P connection
    Then all content sharing should use end-to-end encryption
    And no content should be uploaded to any cloud service
    And both parties should maintain complete control over their content
    And the collaboration should comply with financial privacy regulations

  Scenario: Enterprise Employee Critical Business Collaboration
    Given Alice is an enterprise employee working on critical business matters
    And Bob is a business partner with proprietary information
    When they collaborate on sensitive documents
    Then all content should remain on their respective systems
    And file size, storage, and time limits should be eliminated
    And the solution should be more cost-efficient than cloud alternatives
    And data sovereignty should be maintained per enterprise policies

  Scenario: AI-Enhanced Content Without Compromising Privacy
    Given Alice shares a document with Bob for collaborative review
    When Alice requests AI-powered content summarization
    Then the AI processing should occur locally on Alice's system
    And the document content should never leave Alice's control
    And the AI summary should be generated without cloud processing
    And Bob should receive the summary while maintaining end-to-end encryption
    And privacy and security should remain uncompromised throughout

  Scenario: Professional Compliance and Data Sovereignty
    Given Alice is an attorney handling privileged client communications
    And Bob is her client sharing confidential legal documents
    When they collaborate using MessagePedia
    Then all content must comply with attorney-client privilege requirements
    And data sovereignty laws must be respected (content stays in jurisdiction)
    And no third-party cloud services should have access to content
    And audit trails should be maintained locally for compliance
