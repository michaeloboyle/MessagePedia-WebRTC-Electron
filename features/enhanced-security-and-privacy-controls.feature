# MessagePedia - The Collective Intelligence App

Feature: Enhanced Security and Privacy Controls

  Scenario: End-to-End Encryption for All Content Types
    Given Alice wants to share various content types with Bob
    When Alice shares text messages, documents, images, and files
    Then all content should be encrypted end-to-end before transmission
    And encryption keys should never be shared with third parties
    And content should only be decryptable by intended recipients
    And metadata should also be encrypted to prevent analysis

  Scenario: Zero-Knowledge Architecture
    Given MessagePedia operates on peer-to-peer networking
    When users collaborate on content
    Then MessagePedia infrastructure should have zero knowledge of content
    And no central servers should store or process user content
    And signaling servers should only facilitate connection establishment
    And user privacy should be maintained at the protocol level

  Scenario: Professional Service Provider Data Isolation
    Given Alice is handling multiple client matters simultaneously
    When Alice collaborates with different clients (Bob, Carol, David)
    Then each client's content should be completely isolated
    And cross-client data leakage should be impossible
    And access controls should prevent unauthorized content sharing
    And audit logs should track all content access by client matter
